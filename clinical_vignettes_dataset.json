    "QUESTION": "Atypical evolutions of benign localization-related epilepsies in children: are they predictable?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "To emphasize that, in some patients, different atypical evolutions occur in the course of so-called benign focal epilepsies of childhood (BFEC) and to promote interest in finding clinical and/or electroencephalographic (EEG) clues to which patients might be prone to these risky evolutions.",
      "Twenty-six patients who started with the typical clinical and EEG features of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) but who had reversible or persistent, serious epileptic events including status epilepticus and language, cognitive, or behavioral impairments were followed for</=14 years. Repeated neurologic examinations, EEG records, and neuropsychological evaluations were done, and brain-imaging studies [computerized axial tomography (CAT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] were obtained in all patients.",
      "The 26 patients were in four separate groups according to the nature of their atypical evolution. Eleven children had atypical benign focal epilepsy of childhood (ABFEC), three with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), seven with status epilepticus of BCECTS, and five with mixed features of the other three groups. All the children whose BCECTS evolved into ABFEC have finally recovered and are attending normal schools, although five have learning difficulties. Two of the three patients diagnosed with LKS recovered from aphasia, although some language difficulties persist in one. The seven who showed status epilepticus of BCECTS are now normal after 3-14 years of follow-up, and three of the five children showing mixed features fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of epilepsy with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWS)."
    ],
    "LONG_ANSWER": "A small proportion of cases starting with BCECTS evolve into ABFEC, LKS, status of BCECTS, or epilepsy with CSWS. In such cases, BCECTS is not always benign. Clinical and EEG markers should be sought to predict these atypical evolutions."

The last and most unlucky case, besides HCC, had a basal cell carcinoma, a colorectal cancer, and a bladder carcinoma. The common data of these 5 patients were the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and the positivity of the HCV RNA polymerase reaction. One patient was also HBV positive."

    "LONG_ANSWER": "Considering that a large number of virus has been found linked to human cancers, our results brought us to hypothesize that HCV could have played an important role not only in the development of HCC but of the second primary malignancy too. This is likely favoured by constitutional or acquired biological and molecular alterations. Tumor suppressor genes alterations have been reported to be frequently linked to cancers of kidney and breast, of colorectal and skin, of prostate, and lymphoemopoietic tissue. Now just these organs are involved in our patients in addition to the liver. Our results, if confirmed, are of a relevant interest, considering that world-wide HCC is constantly increasing for the spreading of the virus risk-factors."

Hepatic metastases are common, and although they can cause significant pain, incapacitating endocrinopathy, and even death, they are usually asymptomatic. The appropriate timing and efficacy of interventions, such as hepatic artery embolization (HAE) and operation, remain controversial.",
      "The records of 85 selected patients referred for treatment of hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases between 1992 and 1998 were reviewed from a prospective database. A multidisciplinary group of surgeons, radiologists, and oncologists managed all patients. Overall survival among this cohort is reported and prognostic variables, which may be predictive of survival, are analyzed.",
      "There were 37 men and 48 women, with a median age of 52 years. There were 41 carcinoid tumors, 26 nonfunctional islet cell tumors, and 18 functional islet cell tumors. Thirty-eight patients had extrahepatic metastases, and in 84% of patients, the liver metastases were bilobar. Eighteen patients were treated with medical therapy or best supportive care, 33 patients underwent HAE, and 34 patients underwent hepatic resection. Both the HAE-related mortality and the 30-day operative mortality rates were 6%. By univariate analysis, earlier resection of the primary tumor, curative intent of treatment, and initial surgical treatment were associated with prolonged survival (p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, only curative intent to treat remained significant (p<0.04). Patients with bilobar or more than 75% liver involvement by tumor were least likely to benefit from surgical resection. One-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for the entire group were 83%, 61%, and 53%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals for patients treated with medical therapy, HAE, and operation were 76%, 39%, and not available; 94%, 83%, and 50%; and 94%, 83%, and 76%, respectively."

      "The study population comprised 165 women with gestational or pregestational diabetes who had sonograms to estimate fetal weight after 36 weeks of gestation and within 2 weeks of delivery. Three measures of accuracy were compared: 1) area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve relating EFW to macrosomia, 2) systematic error, and 3) absolute error. For each measure, the 31 formulas were rank-ordered from 1 (best) to 31 (worst). For each formula, the three rank scores were summed to give a total score. The formula with the lowest total score was considered the \"best\" formula.",
      "Macrosomia occurred in 49 cases (30%). Areas under the ROC curves ranged from 0.8361-0.8978. Differences in areas were not significantly different between the 31 formulas. The 1986 formula of Ott et al. had the lowest total score. Using this \"best\" formula, an EFW of 4,000 gm or more had a sensitivity of 45% to predict macrosomia and a positive predictive value of 81%. To achieve 90% sensitivity with this formula would have required diagnosis of macrosomia with an EFW of 3,535 gm or more, but this would have comprised 46% of the population with a 42% false-positive rate. All 31 formulas were better at predicting macrosomia than predictions based on gestational age alone, and 28 were better than predictions based on abdominal circumference alone."
    ],
    "LONG_ANSWER": "All 31 formulas for EFW had comparably poor accuracy for prediction of macrosomia. Delivery decisions based on EFW will often be in error. Future studies should determine whether specific sonographic measurements, ratios, or differences are better than EFW or birthweight as predictors of birth trauma."

In addition, hypoxic vascular response might involve endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Therefore, we investigated, in rabbit aortic rings, 1) the influence of halothane and isoflurane on vasodilation at 95% O2 and on hypoxic-induced vasorelaxation at 0% O2 and 2) the influence of halothane and isoflurane on endothelium-dependent and -independent post-hypoxic vascular response.",

    "QUESTION": "Epidemic obesity: are genetic factors involved via increased rates of assortative mating?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Prevalence rates of obesity have been increasing in several countries over the past two decades. Mainly secular changes in energy intake and expenditure have been invoked to underly the increasing rates; genetic factors have not been considered because of the very recency of this phenomenon. We hypothesize that genetic factors might very well be involved via an increased rate of assortative mating between obese individuals. We speculate that the recent upsurge in social stigmatization of obese individuals underlies the hypothesized increase in assortative mating.",
      "To accumulate evidence for our hypothesis we analysed deduced rates of assortative mating among parents of extremely obese children and adolescents, who belonged to two different large study groups (n = 201 and n = 270). For this purpose we calculated parental body mass indices (BMIs) based on (a) measured current heights and weights, (b) self-reported current heights and weights, and finally (c) measured current heights and recalled weights at ages 20 and 30, respectively. BMI centiles were determined which in turn were attributed to the respective BMI decile. Deduced rates of assortative mating were evaluated in bivariate histograms of the paternal and maternal BMI deciles.",
      "High rates of assortative mating were observed as deduced from the bivariate histograms, which revealed a fairly consistent pattern. Thus, in the first study group almost 35% of the parental pairs had a BMI in the tenth decile; over 50% of the mothers and fathers had a BMI in this top decile. Recalled parental BMIs at ages 20 and 30 also clustered in the upper decile. These results were basically replicated in the second study group. In addition, parental loading on the tenth decile was shown to be higher for the subgroup of children and adolescents who had a BMI equal to or exceeding the highest BMI of the population-based age and gender matched control group."
    ],
    "LONG_ANSWER": "Our results indicate that assortative mating is common among parents of extremely obese children and adolescents, ascertained between 1995 and 1997. In addition, the parental loading on the tenth decile is most prominent for the most obese children. Whereas we are unable to document an increased rate of assortative mating, we interpret our results as being consistent with the hypothesis that an increased rate of assortative mating has contributed to the recent rise in obesity rates in several countries. Thus, assortative mating warrants further studies to assess its impact on obesity prevalence rates through both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms. Our results suggest that assortative mating might especially increase the rates for extreme obesity."

The effects of some of these mutations on the alpha-subunit channel properties can be blocked by type Ib antiarrhythmic drugs. Recently, we have described a new SCN5A mutation (D1790G) that affects the channel properties in a manner suggesting that sodium blockers of the Ib type will be ineffective in carriers of this mutation. Hence, the ECG effects of flecainide-acetate, a type Ic sodium blocker, were evaluated in carriers of this mutation.",

Flecainide significantly shortened all heart rate-corrected repolarization duration parameters only in carriers and not in control subjects: QT(c) shortened by 9.5% (from 517+/-45 to 468+/-36 ms, P=0.011), and the S-offset to T-onset interval shortened by 64.7% (from 187+/-88 to 66+/-50 ms, P=0.0092).

      "Ten patients with stage III NSCLC were planned using a conventional 3D technique and a technique involving noncoplanar beam intensity modulation (BIM). Two planning target volumes (PTVs) were defined: PTV1 included macroscopic tumor volume and PTV2 included macroscopic and microscopic tumor volume. Virtual simulation defined the beam shapes and incidences as well as the wedge orientations (3D) and segment outlines (BIM). Weights of wedged beams, unwedged beams, and segments were determined by optimization using an objective function with a biological and a physical component. The biological component included tumor control probability (TCP) for PTV1 (TCP1), PTV2 (TCP2), and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for lung, spinal cord, and heart. The physical component included the maximum and minimum dose as well as the standard deviation of the dose at PTV1. The most inhomogeneous target-dose distributions were obtained by using only the biological component of the objective function (biological optimization). By enabling the physical component in addition to the biological component, PTV1 inhomogeneity was reduced (biophysical optimization). As indices for toxicity to normal tissues, NTCP-values as well as maximum doses or dose levels to relevant fractions of the organ's volume were used. As indices for tumor control, TCP-values as well as minimum doses to the PTVs were used.",
      "When optimization was performed with the biophysical as compared to the biological objective function, the PTV1 inhomogeneity decreased from 13 (8-23)% to 4 (2-9)% for the 3D-(p = 0.00009) and from 44 (33-56)% to 20 (9-34)% for the BIM plans (p<0. 00001). Minimum PTV1 doses (expressed as the lowest voxel-dose) were similar for both objective functions. The mean and maximum target doses were significantly higher with biological optimization for 3D as well as for BIM (all p values<0.001). Tumor control probability (estimated by TCP1 x TCP2) was 4.7% (3D) and 6.2% (BIM) higher for biological optimization (p = 0.01 and p = 0.00002 respectively). NTCP(lung) as well as the percentage of lung volume exceeding 20 Gy was higher with the use of the biophysical objective function. NTCP(heart) was also higher with the use of the biophysical objective function. The percentage of heart volume exceeding 40 Gy tended to be higher but the difference was not significant. For spinal cord, the maximum dose as well as NTCP(cord) were similar for 3D plans (D(max): p = 0.04; NTCP: p = 0.2) but were significantly lower for BIM (D(max): p = 0.002; NTCP: p = 0.008) if the biophysical objective function was used."
    ],
    "LONG_ANSWER": "When using conventional 3D techniques, inhomogeneous dose distributions offer the potential to further increase the probability of uncomplicated local control. When using techniques as BIM that would lead to large escalation of the median and maximum target doses, it seems indicated to limit target-dose inhomogeneity to avoid dose levels that are so high that the safety becomes questionable."

      "The 26 patients were in four separate groups according to the nature of their atypical evolution. Eleven children had atypical benign focal epilepsy of childhood (ABFEC), three with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), seven with status epilepticus of BCECTS, and five with mixed features of the other three groups. All the children whose BCECTS evolved into ABFEC have finally recovered and are attending normal schools, although five have learning difficulties. Two of the three patients diagnosed with LKS recovered from aphasia, although some language difficulties persist in one. The seven who showed status epilepticus of BCECTS are now normal after 3-14 years of follow-up, and three of the five children showing mixed features fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of epilepsy with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWS)."
    ],
    "LONG_ANSWER": "A small proportion of cases starting with BCECTS evolve into ABFEC, LKS, status of BCECTS, or epilepsy with CSWS. In such cases, BCECTS is not always benign. Clinical and EEG markers should be sought to predict these atypical evolutions."

    "QUESTION": "Are negative mood states associated with cognitive function in newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "The association of self-reported subclinical depressive symptoms and negative mood states with cognitive functioning was evaluated in 51 consecutive newly diagnosed adult persons with epilepsy.",
      "Emotional state was assessed with Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Brief Depression Scale (BDS) and was correlated with a battery of neuropsychological tests.",
      "Patients with epilepsy reported more depressive symptoms in BDS than in controls. They also had more feeling of bewilderment and less vigor on POMS. Higher scores in BDS and in POMS inefficiency scale were associated with slower nondominant hand tapping, but emotional state did not correlate with cognitive measures within the epilepsy group."
    ],
    "LONG_ANSWER": "Self-reported symptoms of depression and negative mood states were not extensively or significantly associated with cognitive function, and they do not explain the cognitive impairments observed in cognition in newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "This prospective controlled study was performed to investigate whether operative procedures of the uterine cervix lead to a change in the titre of humoral antispermatozoal antibodies.",
      "Humoral antispermatozoal antibodies were measured using an ELISA in 15 patients undergoing cervical scraping, 20 having conisation, 10 having a loop excision before and at least 3 months after surgery as well as in 10 fertile women as a control group.",
      "There were no significant differences in age between groups, in the distribution of initial and final levels of humoral antispermatozoal antibodies (IgG, IgA), and no significant change of the antibody titres (pre- and postoperative) within the individual groups."
    ],
    "LONG_ANSWER": "In patients of fertile age, the formation of humoral isoantibodies does not have to be taken into account in selecting the method of diagnosing and treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)."

    "QUESTION": "Hepatitis C virus: a high risk factor for a second primary malignancy besides hepatocellular carcinoma. Fact or fiction?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Second primary malignancies occur more and more often. But the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) linked to a second primary cancer is not frequent.",
      "A retrospective study focused on a second primary cancer was performed in 37 patients with HCC, aged between 46 and 81 years, 27 males and 10 females.",
      "5 out of them (13.5%), 3 males and 2 females, developed a second primary neoplasm before or after HCC. In 3 cases the second malignancy was a carcinoma of the kidney, of the breast, and the prostate. The fourth patient had a Hodgkin's lymphoma before HCC. The last and most unlucky case, besides HCC, had a basal cell carcinoma, a colorectal cancer, and a bladder carcinoma. The common data of these 5 patients were the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and the positivity of the HCV RNA polymerase reaction. One patient was also HBV positive."
    ],
    "LONG_ANSWER": "Considering that a large number of virus has been found linked to human cancers, our results brought us to hypothesize that HCV could have played an important role not only in the development of HCC but of the second primary malignancy too. This is likely favoured by constitutional or acquired biological and molecular alterations. Tumor suppressor genes alterations have been reported to be frequently linked to cancers of kidney and breast, of colorectal and skin, of prostate, and lymphoemopoietic tissue. Now just these organs are involved in our patients in addition to the liver. Our results, if confirmed, are of a relevant interest, considering that world-wide HCC is constantly increasing for the spreading of the virus risk-factors."

    "QUESTION": "Hepatic neuroendocrine metastases: does intervention alter outcomes?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "In most instances, advanced neuroendocrine tumors follow an indolent course. Hepatic metastases are common, and although they can cause significant pain, incapacitating endocrinopathy, and even death, they are usually asymptomatic. The appropriate timing and efficacy of interventions, such as hepatic artery embolization (HAE) and operation, remain controversial.",
      "The records of 85 selected patients referred for treatment of hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases between 1992 and 1998 were reviewed from a prospective database. A multidisciplinary group of surgeons, radiologists, and oncologists managed all patients. Overall survival among this cohort is reported and prognostic variables, which may be predictive of survival, are analyzed.",
      "There were 37 men and 48 women, with a median age of 52 years. There were 41 carcinoid tumors, 26 nonfunctional islet cell tumors, and 18 functional islet cell tumors. Thirty-eight patients had extrahepatic metastases, and in 84% of patients, the liver metastases were bilobar. Eighteen patients were treated with medical therapy or best supportive care, 33 patients underwent HAE, and 34 patients underwent hepatic resection. Both the HAE-related mortality and the 30-day operative mortality rates were 6%. By univariate analysis, earlier resection of the primary tumor, curative intent of treatment, and initial surgical treatment were associated with prolonged survival (p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, only curative intent to treat remained significant (p<0.04). Patients with bilobar or more than 75% liver involvement by tumor were least likely to benefit from surgical resection. One-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for the entire group were 83%, 61%, and 53%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals for patients treated with medical therapy, HAE, and operation were 76%, 39%, and not available; 94%, 83%, and 50%; and 94%, 83%, and 76%, respectively."
    ],
    "LONG_ANSWER": "Hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumors are best managed with a multidisciplinary approach. Both HAE and surgical resection provide excellent palliation of hormonal and pain symptoms. In select patients, surgical resection of hepatic metastases may prolong survival, but is rarely curative."
