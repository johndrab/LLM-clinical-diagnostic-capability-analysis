# LLM Clinical Diagnostic Capability Analysis

This repository contains the dataset, prompts, and evaluation scripts for our ECS 289G project assessing the diagnostic reasoning abilities of general-purpose large language models (GPT-4.1, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, and Gemini-2.5-Flash). The project evaluates models across three prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using a curated set of 50 clinical vignettes.

## Summary
Models are assessed along four dimensions: Plausibility, Faithfulness, Calibration, and Safety. This lightweight framework enables comparison of reasoning quality and diagnostic accuracy across different LLMs.
