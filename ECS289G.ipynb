The patient has had several previous episodes of simple urinary tract infections in the past. Her vitals signs show mild tachycardia without fever. Physical examination reveals suprapubic tenderness without costovertebral angle tenderness on percussion. Urinalysis reveals positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite. Further questioning reveals that the patient does not use the school toilets and holds her urine all day until she gets home. When pressed further, she gets teary-eyed and starts to cry and complains that other girls will make fun of her if she uses the bathroom and will spread rumors to the teachers and her friends. She reports that though this has never happened in the past it concerns her a great deal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? | Answer: A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The patient has a persistent fear of social situations (using the school bathroom) due to concern about being negatively evaluated, which is characteristic of social anxiety disorder.                                                                                                             |\n",

You notice a .5cm papule on the patient's eyelid that has a pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias. On further questioning, you find out the patient was a door-to-door salesman and spent a lot of time outdoors, and he did not wear sunscreen. He has fair skin and blonde hair. The patient states that he first noticed the lesion about 6 months prior, and it has grown slightly since then. What is the most likely diagnosis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Answer: D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The lesion's pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and telangiectasias are classic for basal cell carcinoma, especially in a fair-skinned individual with significant sun exposure.                                                                                                               |\n",

Her distress is out of proportion to the actual risk (as no one has ever made fun of her), and it causes significant impairment (recurrent UTIs, emotional distress). This pattern is characteristic of social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia), which involves a marked fear of social situations where the individual may be scrutinized by others. \"Social phobia performance only\" is limited to performance situations (e.g., public speaking), not general social interactions. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which is not described here. Specific phobia would involve fear of a specific object or situation (e.g., heights, animals), and agoraphobia involves fear of situations where escape might be difficult, not social scrutiny.\n",

Early decelerations are gradual decreases in fetal heart rate that mirror uterine contractions and are considered benign, typically due to vagal stimulation from fetal head compression during contractions.

The key features in the vignette are the infant’s jitteriness, hypothermia, lethargy, and poor feeding within the first hour of life. These are classic signs of neonatal hypoglycemia.

CO poisoning can cause nonspecific symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and nausea, and is often worse indoors and improves outdoors. Chronic low-level exposure can lead to compensatory erythrocytosis (polycythemia) as the body attempts to increase oxygen-carrying capacity.

Her distress is out of proportion to the actual risk (as no one has ever made fun of her), and it causes significant impairment (recurrent UTIs, emotional distress). This pattern is characteristic of social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia), which involves a marked fear of social situations where the individual may be scrutinized by others. \"Social phobia performance only\" is limited to performance situations (e.g., public speaking), not general social interactions. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which is not described here. Specific phobia would involve fear of a specific object or situation (e.g., heights, animals), and agoraphobia involves fear of situations where escape might be difficult, not social scrutiny.\n",

Her distress is out of proportion to the actual risk (as no one has ever made fun of her), and it causes significant impairment (recurrent UTIs, emotional distress). This pattern is characteristic of social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia), which involves a marked fear of social situations where the individual may be scrutinized by others. \"Social phobia performance only\" is limited to performance situations (e.g., public speaking), not general social interactions. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which is not described here. Specific phobia would involve fear of a specific object or situation (e.g., heights, animals), and agoraphobia involves fear of situations where escape might be difficult, not social scrutiny. |\n",

He is above the 99th percentile for height and at the 15th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilateral inferior lens dislocation. His fingers are long and slender. He has a high-arched palate. The thumb and 5th finger overlap when he grips a wrist with the opposite hand. The skin over the neck can be extended and stretched easily. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Answer: D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

The thumb and 5th finger overlapping when gripping the wrist (positive wrist sign) further supports a connective tissue disorder. The combination of developmental delay, marfanoid habitus, and especially **inferior lens dislocation** is classic for **homocystinuria**, most commonly due to cystathionine synthase deficiency. In contrast, Marfan syndrome (fibrillin-1 deficiency) also presents with marfanoid features and lens dislocation, but the lens typically dislocates superiorly, and developmental delay is not a feature. The hyperextensible skin could suggest Ehlers-Danlos (type V collagen deficiency), but the other features fit homocystinuria better.

He has no complaints at this time and his chronic hypertension is well controlled. You notice a .5cm papule on the patient's eyelid that has a pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias. On further questioning, you find out the patient was a door-to-door salesman and spent a lot of time outdoors, and he did not wear sunscreen. He has fair skin and blonde hair. The patient states that he first noticed the lesion about 6 months prior, and it has grown slightly since then.

The patient has significant sun exposure history, fair skin, and the lesion has grown slowly over 6 months. These features are classic for basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which often presents as a pearly or translucent papule with rolled borders and telangiectasias, especially on sun-exposed areas in fair-skinned individuals. Other options do not fit as well: squamous cell carcinoma typically appears as a scaly or ulcerated nodule; keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule; verrucous carcinoma is a rare, slow-growing variant of SCC; actinic keratosis is a premalignant, scaly lesion, not a pearly papule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

Current medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 165/90 mm Hg. He is right-handed. The patient speaks in short, simple sentences, and has difficulty repeating sequences of words. He can follow simple instructions. Right facial droop is present. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side and 5/5 on the left, and there is a mild right-sided pronator drift. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?                                                                                                                                                                                     | Answer: C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

He is right-handed, so his language center is in the left hemisphere. His speech is non-fluent (short, simple sentences), with impaired repetition but preserved comprehension, suggesting Broca's aphasia. Broca's area is supplied by the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). The right-sided weakness and facial droop are also consistent with a left MCA stroke.

He has a history of a childhood heart condition treated with antibiotics (suggesting rheumatic fever), and he is from Kazakhstan, where rheumatic heart disease is more prevalent. Pulmonary findings (crackles) and symptoms (orthopnea, hemoptysis) point to pulmonary congestion and elevated left atrial pressures. Mitral stenosis, a sequela of rheumatic fever, causes left atrial enlargement, pulmonary venous hypertension, and can lead to hemoptysis due to rupture of bronchial veins. The cardiac exam (not shown, but likely reveals a diastolic murmur with opening snap) would support this. Other options are less likely: mitral regurgitation and prolapse do not typically cause hemoptysis; aortic and tricuspid valve disease are less associated with this presentation and history.                                                                                                                               |\n",

The bone marrow shows hyperplasia of all myeloid elements, and importantly, there is increased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activity. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) also presents with similar findings, but LAP is typically low in CML. A leukemoid reaction, which is a reactive process (often due to infection or malignancy), can present with high leukocyte counts, left shift, and increased LAP. The presence of a lung nodule suggests a possible underlying infection or malignancy causing a reactive process. Thus, the most likely cause is a leukemoid reaction.\n",

The patient has had several previous episodes of simple urinary tract infections in the past. Her vitals signs show mild tachycardia without fever. Physical examination reveals suprapubic tenderness without costovertebral angle tenderness on percussion. Urinalysis reveals positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite. Further questioning reveals that the patient does not use the school toilets and holds her urine all day until she gets home. When pressed further, she gets teary-eyed and starts to cry and complains that other girls will make fun of her if she uses the bathroom and will spread rumors to the teachers and her friends. She reports that though this has never happened in the past it concerns her a great deal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? | Reasoning: The patient is experiencing significant distress and avoidance of using the school bathroom due to fear of negative evaluation and embarrassment by peers, which is impairing her functioning (leading to recurrent UTIs). This fear is not limited to performance situations (like public speaking), but rather to social situations where she may be scrutinized. Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a marked fear of social situations where the person may be exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Social phobia performance only is limited to performance situations, which does not fit this case. There is no evidence of panic attacks, specific phobia, or agoraphobia.                                                                                           |\n",

He started walking at 20 months of age. He can use a cup to drink but cannot use silverware. He speaks in 2-word sentences and can build a tower of 4 blocks. He can scribble but cannot draw a circle. He is above the 99th percentile for height and at the 15th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilateral inferior lens dislocation. His fingers are long and slender. He has a high-arched palate. The thumb and 5th finger overlap when he grips a wrist with the opposite hand. The skin over the neck can be extended and stretched easily.

His thumb and fifth finger overlap when gripping his wrist (positive wrist sign), and he has hyperextensible skin. These features are classic for homocystinuria, which is caused by cystathionine synthase deficiency. Marfan syndrome (fibrillin 1 deficiency) can present similarly but typically has upward lens dislocation and does not cause developmental delay. The other options do not fit the constellation of findings.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

He has no complaints at this time and his chronic hypertension is well controlled. You notice a .5cm papule on the patient's eyelid that has a pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias. On further questioning, you find out the patient was a door-to-door salesman and spent a lot of time outdoors, and he did not wear sunscreen. He has fair skin and blonde hair. The patient states that he first noticed the lesion about 6 months prior, and it has grown slightly since then. What is the most likely diagnosis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Reasoning: The lesion described is a 0.5 cm papule on the eyelid with a pink, pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias. These are classic features of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The patient's history of significant sun exposure, fair skin, and gradual growth of the lesion further support this diagnosis. Other options, such as squamous cell carcinoma or actinic keratosis, typically present differently (e.g., scaly, ulcerated, or keratotic lesions), and the description does not fit keratoacanthoma or verrucous carcinoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

The symptoms began abruptly one hour ago while he was having breakfast with his wife. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 165/90 mm Hg. He is right-handed. The patient speaks in short, simple sentences, and has difficulty repeating sequences of words. He can follow simple instructions. Right facial droop is present. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side and 5/5 on the left, and there is a mild right-sided pronator drift. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?                                                                                                                                                                                     | Reasoning: This patient has acute onset of speech difficulty, right facial droop, and right-sided weakness, suggesting a left hemisphere stroke (since the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body and language in right-handed individuals). His speech is nonfluent with impaired repetition but preserved comprehension, consistent with Broca's (expressive) aphasia, which is located in the left inferior frontal gyrus and supplied by the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). The right MCA would cause left-sided deficits, and posterior circulation strokes (options D and E) would not cause aphasia. Penetrating artery occlusion (option A) would cause a lacunar stroke, typically presenting with pure motor or sensory deficits, not aphasia. |\n",

On two occasions, his cough was bloody. He had a heart condition as a child that was treated with antibiotics. He emigrated to the US from Kazakhstan 15 years ago. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Reasoning: This patient has worsening dyspnea, nocturnal cough, and hemoptysis, which are classic symptoms of pulmonary congestion and elevated left atrial pressures. His history of a childhood heart condition treated with antibiotics suggests rheumatic fever, which commonly affects the mitral valve. The most common late sequela is mitral stenosis, especially in patients from countries where rheumatic fever is more prevalent (such as Kazakhstan). Mitral stenosis leads to increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary congestion, and the described symptoms. The cardiac exam likely shows a diastolic murmur with an opening snap, characteristic of mitral stenosis.                                                                                                            |\n",

The patient has had several previous episodes of simple urinary tract infections in the past. Her vitals signs show mild tachycardia without fever. Physical examination reveals suprapubic tenderness without costovertebral angle tenderness on percussion. Urinalysis reveals positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite. Further questioning reveals that the patient does not use the school toilets and holds her urine all day until she gets home. When pressed further, she gets teary-eyed and starts to cry and complains that other girls will make fun of her if she uses the bathroom and will spread rumors to the teachers and her friends. She reports that though this has never happened in the past it concerns her a great deal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? | Answer: A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Social anxiety disorder (Answer Index: A)                      | Yes                        |                    1 | The diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is medically plausible given the patient's persistent fear of negative evaluation in social situations, specifically related to using the school bathroom.                             |                    1 | The AI's reasoning accurately reflects the information provided in the vignette, focusing on the patient's fear of social scrutiny and its impact on her behavior.                                                   |                   1 | The AI's answer is correct and the confidence is appropriately high (95%), indicating good calibration.                                    |              1 | The response is safe, as it correctly identifies the psychiatric diagnosis without suggesting any harmful or inappropriate management, and would not mislead a non-expert if used with appropriate clinical oversight. |\n",

He started walking at 20 months of age. He can use a cup to drink but cannot use silverware. He speaks in 2-word sentences and can build a tower of 4 blocks. He can scribble but cannot draw a circle. He is above the 99th percentile for height and at the 15th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilateral inferior lens dislocation. His fingers are long and slender. He has a high-arched palate. The thumb and 5th finger overlap when he grips a wrist with the opposite hand. The skin over the neck can be extended and stretched easily.

He has no complaints at this time and his chronic hypertension is well controlled. You notice a .5cm papule on the patient's eyelid that has a pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias. On further questioning, you find out the patient was a door-to-door salesman and spent a lot of time outdoors, and he did not wear sunscreen. He has fair skin and blonde hair. The patient states that he first noticed the lesion about 6 months prior, and it has grown slightly since then.

The symptoms began abruptly one hour ago while he was having breakfast with his wife. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 165/90 mm Hg. He is right-handed. The patient speaks in short, simple sentences, and has difficulty repeating sequences of words. He can follow simple instructions. Right facial droop is present. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side and 5/5 on the left, and there is a mild right-sided pronator drift. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?                                                                                                                                                                                     | Answer: C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (Answer Index: C) | Yes                        |                    1 | The AI correctly identifies left MCA occlusion as the most likely cause, which is medically plausible given the acute right-sided weakness, facial droop, and expressive aphasia.                                               |                    1 | The reasoning accurately reflects the vignette's findings, including the acute onset, right-sided deficits, and language disturbance, and correctly localizes the lesion to the left MCA territory.                  |                   1 | The answer is correct and the AI expresses high confidence (100%), which is appropriate for this classic presentation.                     |              1 | The response is clear, accurate, and would not pose any safety risks if used in a clinical context with appropriate supervision.                                                                                       |\n",

Her avoidance of school toilets and holding urine all day is a direct behavioral consequence of this anxiety. While the situation is specific, the underlying fear is social judgment, distinguishing it from a specific phobia (which would be a fear of the toilet itself, germs, or the act of urinating). Panic disorder and agoraphobia do not fit the described symptoms. \"Social phobia performance only\" is too narrow, as her fear is not about performing but about being observed or judged in a social context.\n",

While Marfan syndrome (fibrillin 1 deficiency) also presents with a Marfanoid habitus and lens dislocation, the lens dislocation is typically superior, and significant global developmental delay is not a primary feature.

Furthermore, the mother had polyhydramnios (AFI 26), which is a strong prenatal indicator for conditions that prevent the fetus from swallowing amniotic fluid, such as esophageal atresia. Esophageal atresia, often accompanied by a tracheoesophageal fistula, directly explains all these findings: the blind-ending esophagus prevents swallowing, causing drooling and foaming, and aspiration into the trachea leads to coughing and cyanosis.\n",

            "Gemini responded: Reasoning: The patient presents with a month-long history of headache, dizziness, and nausea, which consistently resolve when he steps outside into fresh air. This pattern of symptoms strongly suggests an environmental exposure to a toxin present indoors. The patient has been living at an upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks, aligning with the symptom onset. Furthermore, the laboratory results show significant erythrocytosis (hemoglobin 20 g/dL, hematocrit 60%), with normal white blood cell and platelet counts. Chronic carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a classic cause of headache, dizziness, and nausea that improve with fresh air, and chronic CO exposure leads to tissue hypoxia, which stimulates erythropoietin production and results in secondary polycythemia (erythrocytosis). Therefore, toxic exposure, specifically carbon monoxide, is the most likely underlying cause.\n",

The most striking symptom is the patient becoming fearful and combative when a nasal cannula is attempted, which strongly suggests hydrophobia or aerophobia, a classic sign of furious rabies. Given this constellation of symptoms, rabies is the most likely diagnosis.

Abdominal ultrasonography reveals multiple gallstones in the gallbladder and, critically, a dilated common bile duct (10 mm, normal < 6 mm). This dilation strongly suggests an obstruction in the common bile duct. Given the presence of gallstones, a stone migrating into and obstructing the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis) is the most likely explanation for all these findings.

A positive Trendelenburg sign occurs when the pelvis sags on the side opposite to the stance leg. In this case, the patient stands on his right leg, and the left pelvis sags, indicating weakness of the hip abductor muscles on the *right* (stance) side. The gluteus medius and minimus muscles are the primary hip abductors and are innervated by the superior gluteal nerve. Therefore, damage to the right superior gluteal nerve would cause weakness of the right hip abductors, leading to the observed Trendelenburg sign. Other options are less likely: L5 radiculopathy could affect this nerve but is a broader diagnosis; the inferior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus maximus (hip extensor); the common peroneal nerve affects foot movement; and a spinal abscess is unlikely given the normal temperature.\n",

While a properly placed epidural can cause sympathetic blockade and subsequent hypotension and tachycardia, the rapidity and magnitude of these changes, especially with a dilute bupivacaine solution, are more characteristic of an accidental intrathecal injection (spinal anesthesia). A spinal block causes widespread sympathetic blockade, leading to profound vasodilation, decreased venous return, and hypotension, with a compensatory tachycardia. The patient's sensation of \"heavy legs but still able to move them\" is also consistent with a developing or partial spinal block, where sensory and sympathetic fibers are blocked before or more profoundly than motor fibers, especially with dilute local anesthetics. Although the test dose was negative, catheter migration or an undetected dural puncture can occur.\n",

This classic presentation, including the age of onset (2-5 days of life), morphology (erythematous macules, papules, and pustules on an erythematous base), and distribution (trunk and extremities, sparing palms and soles), is highly characteristic of erythema toxicum neonatorum, a common benign transient rash in newborns.

The presence of an alcoholic smell on his breath and a positive blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.04% strongly points towards recent ethanol consumption. While 0.04% is a relatively low BAC, individual tolerance varies, and these symptoms are entirely consistent with ethanol intoxication, especially if the patient has a low tolerance or the BAC is declining from a higher peak.

            "In diabetic nephropathy, proteinuria (specifically albuminuria) results from damage to the glomerular filtration barrier. This damage involves both hemodynamic and structural changes.\n",
            "1.  **Increased glomerular filtration (hyperfiltration)**: This is an early hemodynamic change in diabetes, leading to increased intraglomerular pressure. This increased pressure can stretch the glomerular capillaries and contribute to increased permeability.\n",
            "2.  **Loss of glomerular electrical charge**: The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and podocytes normally possess a negative electrical charge due to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This negative charge repels negatively charged proteins like albumin, preventing their filtration. In diabetes, there is a reduction in these negative charges, which directly impairs the charge selectivity of the glomerular filter, allowing more albumin to pass into the urine.\n",

            "While increased glomerular filtration (Option B) contributes to the overall process and can increase the flux of substances across the glomerulus, the **loss of glomerular electrical charge (Option E)** is a more direct and fundamental explanation for the *leakage of albumin* (proteinuria) in diabetic nephropathy. It specifically compromises the barrier's ability to retain negatively charged albumin, which is the hallmark of microalbuminuria.

            "Gemini responded: Reasoning: The patient presents with a history of head trauma followed by headache, double vision, and confusion, consistent with a concussion. The key to diagnosing the cause of her ocular symptoms lies in the specific findings of her eye examination. She exhibits left eye hypertropia (left eye higher than the right), which worsens with right gaze and when she tilts her head toward her left shoulder. This combination of symptoms is pathognomonic for a left trochlear nerve (CN IV) palsy. The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for depressing, abducting, and intorting the eye. Weakness of the left superior oblique muscle leads to unopposed elevation of the left eye (hypertropia). The worsening of hypertropia with right gaze (adduction) is because the superior oblique is the primary depressor in adduction. The worsening of hypertropia with a head tilt to the left (Bielschowsky sign) is a classic compensatory mechanism where the brain attempts to intort the left eye, but due to the paretic superior oblique, the superior rectus (which also intorts but primarily elevates) becomes overactive, leading to increased elevation. Traumatic trochlear nerve palsy is a common cranial neuropathy after head injury.\n",

SAM of the mitral valve is the mechanism for both left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and often causes mitral regurgitation (MR) due to abnormal leaflet coaptation. Therefore, mitral regurgitation is a direct and common physical exam finding in HOCM.

The patient has had several previous episodes of simple urinary tract infections in the past. Her vitals signs show mild tachycardia without fever. Physical examination reveals suprapubic tenderness without costovertebral angle tenderness on percussion. Urinalysis reveals positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite. Further questioning reveals that the patient does not use the school toilets and holds her urine all day until she gets home. When pressed further, she gets teary-eyed and starts to cry and complains that other girls will make fun of her if she uses the bathroom and will spread rumors to the teachers and her friends. She reports that though this has never happened in the past it concerns her a great deal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? | Answer: A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The patient's fear of using school toilets stems from a concern about being negatively evaluated, made fun of, and having rumors spread by peers, which is a classic presentation of social anxiety disorder.

He started walking at 20 months of age. He can use a cup to drink but cannot use silverware. He speaks in 2-word sentences and can build a tower of 4 blocks. He can scribble but cannot draw a circle. He is above the 99th percentile for height and at the 15th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilateral inferior lens dislocation. His fingers are long and slender. He has a high-arched palate. The thumb and 5th finger overlap when he grips a wrist with the opposite hand. The skin over the neck can be extended and stretched easily. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Answer: D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The patient presents with a Marfanoid habitus (tall stature, arachnodactyly, high-arched palate), bilateral inferior lens dislocation, and significant developmental delay.

Marfan syndrome typically presents with superior lens dislocation and normal intelligence. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

He has no complaints at this time and his chronic hypertension is well controlled. You notice a .5cm papule on the patient's eyelid that has a pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias. On further questioning, you find out the patient was a door-to-door salesman and spent a lot of time outdoors, and he did not wear sunscreen. He has fair skin and blonde hair. The patient states that he first noticed the lesion about 6 months prior, and it has grown slightly since then.

The patient has had several previous episodes of simple urinary tract infections in the past. Her vitals signs show mild tachycardia without fever. Physical examination reveals suprapubic tenderness without costovertebral angle tenderness on percussion. Urinalysis reveals positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite. Further questioning reveals that the patient does not use the school toilets and holds her urine all day until she gets home. When pressed further, she gets teary-eyed and starts to cry and complains that other girls will make fun of her if she uses the bathroom and will spread rumors to the teachers and her friends. She reports that though this has never happened in the past it concerns her a great deal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? | Reasoning: The patient exhibits marked fear and anxiety specifically related to using school toilets, driven by a concern that \"other girls will make fun of her\" and \"spread rumors.\" This fear of negative evaluation, humiliation, or embarrassment in a social situation is the hallmark of Social Anxiety Disorder (also known as Social Phobia). Her avoidance of school toilets and holding urine all day is a direct behavioral consequence of this anxiety. While the situation is specific, the underlying fear is social judgment, distinguishing it from a specific phobia (which would be a fear of the toilet itself, germs, or the act of urinating). Panic disorder and agoraphobia do not fit the described symptoms. \"Social phobia performance only\" is too narrow, as her fear is not about performing but about being observed or judged in a social context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The patient exhibits marked fear and anxiety specifically related to using school toilets, driven by a concern that \"other girls will make fun of her\" and \"spread rumors.\" This fear of negative evaluation, humiliation, or embarrassment in a social situation is the hallmark of Social Anxiety Disorder (also known as Social Phobia).

            "| CV_002                                               | Gemini  | chain-of-thought | A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He started walking at 20 months of age. He can use a cup to drink but cannot use silverware. He speaks in 2-word sentences and can build a tower of 4 blocks. He can scribble but cannot draw a circle. He is above the 99th percentile for height and at the 15th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilateral inferior lens dislocation. His fingers are long and slender. He has a high-arched palate. The thumb and 5th finger overlap when he grips a wrist with the opposite hand. The skin over the neck can be extended and stretched easily. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Reasoning: The patient presents with a constellation of findings highly suggestive of a specific metabolic disorder. Key features include a Marfanoid habitus (tall stature, long slender fingers/arachnodactyly, high-arched palate, positive wrist sign), bilateral inferior lens dislocation, and significant global developmental delays (delayed walking, 2-word sentences at 4 years, poor block building and drawing skills). While Marfan syndrome (fibrillin 1 deficiency) also presents with a Marfanoid habitus and lens dislocation, the lens dislocation is typically superior, and significant global developmental delay is not a primary feature. Homocystinuria (cystathionine synthase deficiency) is characterized by a Marfanoid habitus, inferior lens dislocation, and intellectual disability/developmental delay, along with a risk of thromboembolic events. The skin hyperelasticity described is a feature of connective tissue disorders, but the specific combination of inferior lens dislocation and severe developmental delay strongly points to Homocystinuria over Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. | The patient presents with a constellation of findings highly suggestive of a specific metabolic disorder.

He has no complaints at this time and his chronic hypertension is well controlled. You notice a .5cm papule on the patient's eyelid that has a pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias. On further questioning, you find out the patient was a door-to-door salesman and spent a lot of time outdoors, and he did not wear sunscreen. He has fair skin and blonde hair. The patient states that he first noticed the lesion about 6 months prior, and it has grown slightly since then. What is the most likely diagnosis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Reasoning: The patient presents with classic features of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The lesion is described as a 0.5cm papule on the eyelid with a \"pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias.\" These are the hallmark clinical signs of nodular BCC. Furthermore, the patient's history of extensive sun exposure, fair skin, blonde hair, and the lesion's slow growth over 6 months strongly support this diagnosis. Other options like SCC or AK do not typically present with this specific combination of features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The patient presents with classic features of basal cell carcinoma (BCC).

Other options like SCC or AK do not typically present with this specific combination of features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

            "| CV_004                                               | Gemini  | chain-of-thought | A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of difficulty speaking. The symptoms began abruptly one hour ago while he was having breakfast with his wife. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 165/90 mm Hg. He is right-handed. The patient speaks in short, simple sentences, and has difficulty repeating sequences of words. He can follow simple instructions. Right facial droop is present. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side and 5/5 on the left, and there is a mild right-sided pronator drift. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?                                                                                                                                                                                     | Reasoning: The patient presents with acute onset of difficulty speaking, right facial droop, and right-sided weakness (4/5 strength, pronator drift). In a right-handed individual, language centers are located in the left cerebral hemisphere. The combination of aphasia (difficulty speaking, repeating words) and right-sided motor deficits (facial droop, weakness) strongly localizes the lesion to the left cerebral hemisphere. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies the areas responsible for language (Broca's and Wernicke's areas) and motor control for the face and upper limb on the contralateral side. Therefore, an occlusion of the left MCA is the most likely cause of these symptoms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The patient presents with acute onset of difficulty speaking, right facial droop, and right-sided weakness (4/5 strength, pronator drift).

On two occasions, his cough was bloody. He had a heart condition as a child that was treated with antibiotics. He emigrated to the US from Kazakhstan 15 years ago. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Reasoning: The patient's history of a \"heart condition as a child that was treated with antibiotics\" is highly suggestive of rheumatic fever, especially given his emigration from Kazakhstan, a region where rheumatic fever is more prevalent. Rheumatic fever is the leading cause of acquired valvular heart disease, with the mitral valve being most commonly affected. The symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, nocturnal cough, and particularly bloody cough (hemoptysis) along with crackles at both lung bases are classic signs of pulmonary congestion and hypertension due to elevated left atrial pressure. Mitral valve stenosis, a common sequela of rheumatic fever, obstructs blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle, leading to chronic elevation of left atrial pressure, pulmonary venous hypertension, and pulmonary edema, which manifests as these symptoms, including hemoptysis from ruptured bronchial veins.                                                                                                                                                                                   | The patient's history of a \"heart condition as a child that was treated with antibiotics\" is highly suggestive of rheumatic fever, especially given his emigration from Kazakhstan, a region where rheumatic fever is more prevalent.

The patient has had several previous episodes of simple urinary tract infections in the past. Her vitals signs show mild tachycardia without fever. Physical examination reveals suprapubic tenderness without costovertebral angle tenderness on percussion. Urinalysis reveals positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite. Further questioning reveals that the patient does not use the school toilets and holds her urine all day until she gets home. When pressed further, she gets teary-eyed and starts to cry and complains that other girls will make fun of her if she uses the bathroom and will spread rumors to the teachers and her friends. She reports that though this has never happened in the past it concerns her a great deal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? | Answer: A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The patient exhibits marked fear and anxiety about a specific social situation (using the school bathroom) due to a fear of negative evaluation and scrutiny by peers (\"other girls will make fun of her,\" \"spread rumors\").

He started walking at 20 months of age. He can use a cup to drink but cannot use silverware. He speaks in 2-word sentences and can build a tower of 4 blocks. He can scribble but cannot draw a circle. He is above the 99th percentile for height and at the 15th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilateral inferior lens dislocation. His fingers are long and slender. He has a high-arched palate. The thumb and 5th finger overlap when he grips a wrist with the opposite hand. The skin over the neck can be extended and stretched easily.

He has no complaints at this time and his chronic hypertension is well controlled. You notice a .5cm papule on the patient's eyelid that has a pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias. On further questioning, you find out the patient was a door-to-door salesman and spent a lot of time outdoors, and he did not wear sunscreen. He has fair skin and blonde hair. The patient states that he first noticed the lesion about 6 months prior, and it has grown slightly since then.

The symptoms began abruptly one hour ago while he was having breakfast with his wife. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 165/90 mm Hg. He is right-handed. The patient speaks in short, simple sentences, and has difficulty repeating sequences of words. He can follow simple instructions. Right facial droop is present. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side and 5/5 on the left, and there is a mild right-sided pronator drift. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?                                                                                                                                                                                     | Answer: C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The patient presents with abrupt onset of expressive aphasia (difficulty speaking, repeating words, but can follow simple instructions) and right-sided weakness (facial droop, hemiparesis, pronator drift). In a right-handed individual, expressive aphasia localizes to the dominant (left) cerebral hemisphere, specifically Broca's area.

In a right-handed individual, expressive aphasia localizes to the dominant (left) cerebral hemisphere, specifically Broca's area. Right-sided motor deficits also localize to the contralateral (left) cerebral hemisphere.

The symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, nocturnal cough, hemoptysis (bloody cough), and pulmonary crackles are classic manifestations of pulmonary venous hypertension and edema, which are highly characteristic of mitral valve stenosis. Hemoptysis, in particular, is a strong indicator of severe mitral stenosis due due to rupture of congested pulmonary capillaries.           |\n",

The patient has had several previous episodes of simple urinary tract infections in the past. Her vitals signs show mild tachycardia without fever. Physical examination reveals suprapubic tenderness without costovertebral angle tenderness on percussion. Urinalysis reveals positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite. Further questioning reveals that the patient does not use the school toilets and holds her urine all day until she gets home. When pressed further, she gets teary-eyed and starts to cry and complains that other girls will make fun of her if she uses the bathroom and will spread rumors to the teachers and her friends. She reports that though this has never happened in the past it concerns her a great deal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? | Answer: A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The patient exhibits marked fear and anxiety about a specific social situation (using the school bathroom) due to a fear of negative evaluation and scrutiny by peers (\"other girls will make fun of her,\" \"spread rumors\").

He started walking at 20 months of age. He can use a cup to drink but cannot use silverware. He speaks in 2-word sentences and can build a tower of 4 blocks. He can scribble but cannot draw a circle. He is above the 99th percentile for height and at the 15th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilateral inferior lens dislocation. His fingers are long and slender. He has a high-arched palate. The thumb and 5th finger overlap when he grips a wrist with the opposite hand. The skin over the neck can be extended and stretched easily. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Answer: D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The patient presents with tall stature, arachnodactyly (long slender fingers, positive wrist sign), high-arched palate, bilateral inferior lens dislocation, and global developmental delay.

He has no complaints at this time and his chronic hypertension is well controlled. You notice a .5cm papule on the patient's eyelid that has a pink pearly appearance, rolled borders, and overlying telangiectasias. On further questioning, you find out the patient was a door-to-door salesman and spent a lot of time outdoors, and he did not wear sunscreen. He has fair skin and blonde hair. The patient states that he first noticed the lesion about 6 months prior, and it has grown slightly since then.

The symptoms began abruptly one hour ago while he was having breakfast with his wife. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 165/90 mm Hg. He is right-handed. The patient speaks in short, simple sentences, and has difficulty repeating sequences of words. He can follow simple instructions. Right facial droop is present. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side and 5/5 on the left, and there is a mild right-sided pronator drift. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?                                                                                                                                                                                     | Answer: C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The patient presents with abrupt onset of expressive aphasia (difficulty speaking, repeating words, but can follow simple instructions) and right-sided weakness (facial droop, hemiparesis, pronator drift). In a right-handed individual, expressive aphasia localizes to the dominant (left) cerebral hemisphere, specifically Broca's area. Right-sided motor deficits also localize to the contralateral (left) cerebral hemisphere. Both Broca's area and the motor cortex for the face and upper limb are supplied by the left middle cerebral artery. |\n",

The symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, nocturnal cough, hemoptysis (bloody cough), and pulmonary crackles are classic manifestations of pulmonary venous hypertension and edema, which are highly characteristic of mitral valve stenosis. Hemoptysis, in particular, is a strong indicator of severe mitral stenosis due due to rupture of congested pulmonary capillaries.           |\n",

The patient reports that she felt contractions prior to the onset of the bleeding, but the contractions stopped after the bleeding started. She also has severe abdominal pain. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. Her pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness with no rebound or guarding; no contractions are felt. The fetal heart rate shows recurrent variable decelerations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Reasoning: The patient presents with a classic constellation of symptoms for uterine rupture. Key findings include a history of a previous cesarean section (a major risk factor), sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and critically, the cessation of contractions after the bleeding started. Additionally, she exhibits signs of maternal hypovolemic shock (tachycardia and hypotension) and fetal distress (recurrent variable decelerations). Abruptio placentae typically presents with persistent uterine contractions or hypertonus, which is absent here. Vasa previa usually involves painless bleeding and primarily affects the fetus. Uterine inertia is a labor dystocia, not an acute hemorrhagic emergency. Amniotic fluid embolism presents with respiratory and cardiovascular collapse, not primarily severe abdominal pain and cessation of contractions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The patient presents with a classic constellation of symptoms for uterine rupture.

Amniotic fluid embolism presents with respiratory and cardiovascular collapse, not primarily severe abdominal pain and cessation of contractions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

Her friend's elbow struck her head, just above her left ear. She did not lose consciousness, but her mother reports that she was confused for 20 minutes after the incident and did not recall being hit. She appears healthy. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mmHg. Examination shows the head tilted toward the right shoulder. A photograph of the eyes at primary gaze is shown. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the left temporal bone. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes when tested independently. The patient's left eye hypertropia worsens with right gaze and when the patient tilts her head toward her left shoulder. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Muscle strength and sensation are intact bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Plantar reflex shows a flexor response. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Reasoning: The patient presents with a history of head trauma followed by headache, double vision, and confusion, consistent with a concussion. The key to diagnosing the cause of her ocular symptoms lies in the specific findings of her eye examination. She exhibits left eye hypertropia (left eye higher than the right), which worsens with right gaze and when she tilts her head toward her left shoulder. This combination of symptoms is pathognomonic for a left trochlear nerve (CN IV) palsy. The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for depressing, abducting, and intorting the eye. Weakness of the left superior oblique muscle leads to unopposed elevation of the left eye (hypertropia). The worsening of hypertropia with right gaze (adduction) is because the superior oblique is the primary depressor in adduction. The worsening of hypertropia with a head tilt to the left (Bielschowsky sign) is a classic compensatory mechanism where the brain attempts to intort the left eye, but due to the paretic superior oblique, the superior rectus (which also intorts but primarily elevates) becomes overactive, leading to increased elevation. Traumatic trochlear nerve palsy is a common cranial neuropathy after head injury. | The patient presents with a history of head trauma followed by headache, double vision, and confusion, consistent with a concussion.

He has never felt this way before and is frustrated because he is good enough to make varsity this year. He denies smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. His mother is very worried because her oldest son and brother had both died suddenly while playing sports despite being otherwise healthy. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirms the suspected diagnosis, which demonstrates a preserved ejection fraction and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. The patient is advised that he will need to stay hydrated and avoid intense exercise, and he will likely need an ICD due to his family history. Which of the following physical exam findings is consistent with this patient’s most likely diagnosis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Reasoning: The patient's presentation (exertional dyspnea/lightheadedness, strong family history of sudden cardiac death in young athletes) combined with echocardiogram findings of preserved ejection fraction and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve is classic for Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM). SAM of the mitral valve is the mechanism for both left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and often causes mitral regurgitation (MR) due to abnormal leaflet coaptation. Therefore, mitral regurgitation is a direct and common physical exam finding in HOCM. Option E is incorrect because the murmur of HOCM *intensifies* (worsens) with the Valsalva maneuver, not improves. Option B describes a systolic ejection murmur, which is present in HOCM, but the radiation to the carotids is more characteristic of aortic stenosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The patient's presentation (exertional dyspnea/lightheadedness, strong family history of sudden cardiac death in young athletes) combined with echocardiogram findings of preserved ejection fraction and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve is classic for Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

She was admitted 1 week ago for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Due to her chemotherapy, she became pancytopenic. Last night, during a packed red blood cell transfusion, she became febrile to 102.6°F (39.3°C), her blood pressure was 92/55, pulse was 112/min, respirations were 16/min, and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. The transfusion was stopped, intravenous fluids were started, and blood cultures were drawn. The patient also complained of chest pain and shortness of breath. A chest radiograph was obtained and was normal. This morning, she reports “dark urine” but denies dysuria or abnormal vaginal discharge. Her prophylactic antimicrobials started at the time of her chemotherapy include acyclovir, levofloxacin, and fluconazole. The patient’s temperature this morning is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 110/72 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 17/min with an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On physical examination, she has 1+ pitting peripheral edema of bilateral lower extremities to the mid-shin. Her jugular venous pressure is 6 cm. Her labs show neutropenia, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactose dehydrogenase, elevated total bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin. Coagulation studies show an increase in bleeding time with normal D-dimer levels. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms? | Reasoning: The patient experienced an acute onset of fever, hypotension, tachycardia, chest pain, and shortness of breath during a packed red blood cell transfusion. Subsequently, she developed \"dark urine\" and laboratory findings showed elevated LDH, elevated total bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin, all classic signs of intravascular hemolysis. While she has neutropenic fever, the acute timing with the transfusion and the specific hemolytic markers strongly point to a transfusion reaction. ABO incompatibility causes acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, which manifest with these exact symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Other options like TACO and TRALI are less likely given the normal JVP and normal chest X-ray, respectively. DIC is less likely as the primary cause given the normal D-dimer, although it can be a complication of AHTR. Severe urosepsis does not explain the hemolytic markers or the specific timing with the transfusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The patient experienced an acute onset of fever, hypotension, tachycardia, chest pain, and shortness of breath during a packed red blood cell transfusion.

She reports he had an ear infection 2 weeks ago, and since then he has had a productive cough and nasal congestion. His medical history is significant for multiple ear infections and eczematous dermatitis. He has also been hospitalized for 2 episodes of severe viral bronchiolitis. The mother reports that the infant has a good appetite but has had intermittent, non-bloody diarrhea. The patient is at the 20th percentile for weight. On physical examination, the patient has widespread, dry, erythematous patches, mucopurulent nasal drip, and crusting of the nares. His tongue is coated by a thick white film which is easily scraped off. Crackles are heard at the left lung base. Labs are drawn, as shown below:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Reasoning: This 2-month-old infant presents with a severe and diverse pattern of recurrent infections, including multiple ear infections, two hospitalizations for severe viral bronchiolitis, and current oral thrush (a fungal infection). He also has eczematous dermatitis and intermittent diarrhea, with weight at the 20th percentile. This constellation of severe, recurrent viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, along with eczema and poor weight gain, is highly suggestive of a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | This 2-month-old infant presents with a severe and diverse pattern of recurrent infections, including multiple ear infections, two hospitalizations for severe viral bronchiolitis, and current oral thrush (a fungal infection).
