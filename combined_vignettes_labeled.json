    "QUESTION": "Atypical evolutions of benign localization-related epilepsies in children: are they predictable?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "To emphasize that, in some patients, different atypical evolutions occur in the course of so-called benign focal epilepsies of childhood (BFEC) and to promote interest in finding clinical and/or electroencephalographic (EEG) clues to which patients might be prone to these risky evolutions.",
      "Twenty-six patients who started with the typical clinical and EEG features of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) but who had reversible or persistent, serious epileptic events including status epilepticus and language, cognitive, or behavioral impairments were followed for</=14 years. Repeated neurologic examinations, EEG records, and neuropsychological evaluations were done, and brain-imaging studies [computerized axial tomography (CAT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] were obtained in all patients.",
      "The 26 patients were in four separate groups according to the nature of their atypical evolution. Eleven children had atypical benign focal epilepsy of childhood (ABFEC), three with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), seven with status epilepticus of BCECTS, and five with mixed features of the other three groups. All the children whose BCECTS evolved into ABFEC have finally recovered and are attending normal schools, although five have learning difficulties. Two of the three patients diagnosed with LKS recovered from aphasia, although some language difficulties persist in one. The seven who showed status epilepticus of BCECTS are now normal after 3-14 years of follow-up, and three of the five children showing mixed features fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of epilepsy with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWS)."

Hepatic metastases are common, and although they can cause significant pain, incapacitating endocrinopathy, and even death, they are usually asymptomatic.

      "The records of 85 selected patients referred for treatment of hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases between 1992 and 1998 were reviewed from a prospective database. A multidisciplinary group of surgeons, radiologists, and oncologists managed all patients. Overall survival among this cohort is reported and prognostic variables, which may be predictive of survival, are analyzed.",
      "There were 37 men and 48 women, with a median age of 52 years. There were 41 carcinoid tumors, 26 nonfunctional islet cell tumors, and 18 functional islet cell tumors. Thirty-eight patients had extrahepatic metastases, and in 84% of patients, the liver metastases were bilobar. Eighteen patients were treated with medical therapy or best supportive care, 33 patients underwent HAE, and 34 patients underwent hepatic resection. Both the HAE-related mortality and the 30-day operative mortality rates were 6%. By univariate analysis, earlier resection of the primary tumor, curative intent of treatment, and initial surgical treatment were associated with prolonged survival (p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, only curative intent to treat remained significant (p<0.04). Patients with bilobar or more than 75% liver involvement by tumor were least likely to benefit from surgical resection. One-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for the entire group were 83%, 61%, and 53%, respectively.

For each measure, the 31 formulas were rank-ordered from 1 (best) to 31 (worst). For each formula, the three rank scores were summed to give a total score.

Using this \"best\" formula, an EFW of 4,000 gm or more had a sensitivity of 45% to predict macrosomia and a positive predictive value of 81%. To achieve 90% sensitivity with this formula would have required diagnosis of macrosomia with an EFW of 3,535 gm or more, but this would have comprised 46% of the population with a 42% false-positive rate.

    "QUESTION": "Epidemic obesity: are genetic factors involved via increased rates of assortative mating?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Prevalence rates of obesity have been increasing in several countries over the past two decades. Mainly secular changes in energy intake and expenditure have been invoked to underly the increasing rates; genetic factors have not been considered because of the very recency of this phenomenon. We hypothesize that genetic factors might very well be involved via an increased rate of assortative mating between obese individuals. We speculate that the recent upsurge in social stigmatization of obese individuals underlies the hypothesized increase in assortative mating.",
      "To accumulate evidence for our hypothesis we analysed deduced rates of assortative mating among parents of extremely obese children and adolescents, who belonged to two different large study groups (n = 201 and n = 270). For this purpose we calculated parental body mass indices (BMIs) based on (a) measured current heights and weights, (b) self-reported current heights and weights, and finally (c) measured current heights and recalled weights at ages 20 and 30, respectively. BMI centiles were determined which in turn were attributed to the respective BMI decile. Deduced rates of assortative mating were evaluated in bivariate histograms of the paternal and maternal BMI deciles.",
      "High rates of assortative mating were observed as deduced from the bivariate histograms, which revealed a fairly consistent pattern. Thus, in the first study group almost 35% of the parental pairs had a BMI in the tenth decile; over 50% of the mothers and fathers had a BMI in this top decile. Recalled parental BMIs at ages 20 and 30 also clustered in the upper decile. These results were basically replicated in the second study group. In addition, parental loading on the tenth decile was shown to be higher for the subgroup of children and adolescents who had a BMI equal to or exceeding the highest BMI of the population-based age and gender matched control group."

In addition, the parental loading on the tenth decile is most prominent for the most obese children. Whereas we are unable to document an increased rate of assortative mating, we interpret our results as being consistent with the hypothesis that an increased rate of assortative mating has contributed to the recent rise in obesity rates in several countries. Thus, assortative mating warrants further studies to assess its impact on obesity prevalence rates through both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms. Our results suggest that assortative mating might especially increase the rates for extreme obesity."

He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline.

      "To determine the frequency of hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome in young adults and to examine the risk factors that predispose to the development of premature heart disease.",
      "Significant coronary heart disease (CHD) is considered rare in the young adult. Current guidelines do not recommend treatment of mild cholesterol abnormalities for primary prevention of CHD in the young.",
      "This is a large case series of 449 adults (<or =50 years) admitted to the hospital with acute coronary syndrome. A history of cardiovascular risk factors and lipid profile were recorded. The presence and extent of CHD were established.",
      "Mean patient age was 44 +/- 6 years. Documented CHD was present in 61% of hospital admissions. Multivariate analysis revealed that history of hypercholesterolemia, history of smoking and diabetes were independently associated with premature CHD. The fasting lipid profiles were only borderline to mildly abnormal. Serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride levels were not different in cases compared with control subjects. Nearly half (49%) of those with LDL levels of>or =160 mg/dl had only one additional risk factor or none. Despite this, a history of hypercholesterolemia had independent and incremental value on other risk factors for the likelihood of premature CHD."

In this population, the presence of borderline or mild hypercholesterolemia has significant effects on the development of premature CHD. These observations have significant implications in the development of guidelines for primary prevention of premature CHD."
